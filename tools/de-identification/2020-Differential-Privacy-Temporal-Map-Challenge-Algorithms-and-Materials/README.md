# 2020 Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge Files

These files pertain to the 2020 Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge. 

This Challenge was hosted in three parts: the Metrics Contest (aka Better Meter Stick Contest) implemented by HeroX, the Algorithm Contest in three sprints implemented by DrivenData, and the Open Source and Development Contest. 

## Metrics Contest 

This contest solicited solvers for their ideas on how to better evaluate the outputs of differentially private algorthms. Winners who elected to share their solutions are stored here. There is also an examplar submission based on the 'Pie Chart Metric' implemented as a scoring function for the first sprint of the Algorithm Contest. 

## Algorithm Contest

This contest solicited solvers for algorithms that satisfy differential privacy that de-identify data containing time and geographic information 

The repo contains the Competitor Packs including: challenge data, scoring scripts, naive differentially private algorithms, and documentation, and any algorithms participants elected to share.  

### Sprint 1 

[This sprint](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/68/competition-differential-privacy-maps-1/) focused on 911 call data from the City of Baltimore with algorithms leading to privatized aggregate data.

### Sprint 2 

[This sprint](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/74/competition-differential-privacy-maps-2/) focused on the American Community Survey data from the US Census with algorithms leading to synthetic data (i.e., list of records).

### Sprint 3

Has not yet begun. This will be updated in the future. 

## Open Source and Development Contest - Improved Algorithms 

This contest invites winners from the Algorithm Contest to submit their solutions to an open source repository. Solvers are also invited to submit a "Development Plan" where they describe a plan to improve their code and documentation in order to make the solutions easier to implement. At the end of their development phase solvers will be invited to resubmit their improved software to an open source repository. This directory will contain the imporved software when available (~ Nov 2021).
